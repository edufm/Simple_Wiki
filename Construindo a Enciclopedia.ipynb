Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the [[List of cities in Germany by population|thirteenth-largest city]] in Germany as well as the third-largest city in [[Northern Germany]] after [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. The city lies at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Leine]] (progression: {{PAller}}) and its [[tributary]] [[Ihme]], in the south of the [[North German Plain]], and is the largest city in the [[Hannover–Braunschweig–Göttingen–Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region]]. It is the fifth-largest city in the [[Low German]] dialect area after Hamburg, [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]] and Bremen.\\n\\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946 Hanover was the capital of the [[Principality of Calenberg]] (1636–1692), the [[Electorate of Hanover]] (1692–1814), the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (1814–1866), the [[Province of Hanover]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1868–1918), the [[Province of Hanover]] of the [[Free State of Prussia]] (1918–1946) and of the [[State of Hanover]] (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by [[personal union]] the family seat of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], under their title of the dukes of [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (later described as the [[Electorate of Hanover|Elector of Hanover]]).\\n\\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways ([[Autobahn]]en), connecting European main lines in both the east-west ([[Berlin]]–[[Ruhr|Ruhr area]]/[[Düsseldorf]]/[[Cologne]]) and north-south ([[Hamburg]]–[[Frankfurt]]/[[Stuttgart]]/[[Munich]]) directions. [[Hannover Airport]] lies north of the city, in [[Langenhagen]], and is Germany\\'s ninth-busiest airport. The city\\'s most notable institutes of higher education are the [[Hannover Medical School]] with its [[university hospital]] (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the [[Leibniz University Hannover]].\\n\\nThe [[Hanover fairground]], owing to numerous extensions, especially for the [[Expo 2000]], is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial [[World\\'s fair|trade fairs]] such as the [[Hanover Fair]] and up to 2018 the [[CeBIT]]. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world\\'s leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the [[Schützenfest Hannover]], the world\\'s largest marksmen\\'s festival, and the [[Oktoberfest celebrations#Hannover|Oktoberfest Hannover]].\\n\\n\\'Hanover\\' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Encyclopædia Britannica] uses \\'Hannover\\'. It says \"\\'\\'English\\'\\' Hanover\" but uses \\'Hannover\\' in the text.</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Microsoft Encarta] gives the primary spelling as \\'Hannover\\'.</ref> and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hannover.de/english/ |title=Official Website of the City and Region of Hannover |publisher=Hannover.de |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref> The English pronunciation, with [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] on the first syllable, is applied to both the [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British [[House of Hanover]].'"
